You are tasked with creating a comprehensive style guide for writing code that future AI prompts should follow. This guide will be used to ensure consistency and best practices in code writing across the project. Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Carefully examine the code in the following directory:

<relevant_directory>
$ARGUMENTS
</relevant_directory>

2. Analyze the code patterns, design choices, and conventions used throughout the project. Pay attention to:

   - Naming conventions (variables, functions, classes)
   - Code organization and structure
   - Commenting and documentation practices
   - Indentation and formatting
   - Error handling and logging
   - Use of design patterns or architectural styles
   - Testing approaches (if visible in the code)

3. Based on your analysis, create a document called STYLE_GUIDE.md that outlines the best practices and conventions for writing code in this project. The style guide should cover the following areas:

   a. Code Formatting
   b. Naming Conventions
   c. Comments and Documentation
   d. Error Handling
   e. Testing
   f. Design Patterns and Architecture
   g. Performance Considerations
   h. Security Best Practices
   i. Version Control Practices

4. For each area, provide clear examples and explanations of the preferred style and approach. Use code snippets from the existing code to illustrate these points when possible.

5. Structure the STYLE_GUIDE.md document with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points for easy readability. Use Markdown formatting to enhance the presentation of the guide.

6. Begin the document with a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the style guide and its importance in maintaining consistent and high-quality code across the project.

7. Conclude the document with a section on how to contribute to or suggest changes to the style guide in the future.

Your final output should be the complete content of the STYLE_GUIDE.md file, formatted in Markdown. Include only the content of the style guide in your response, without any additional commentary or explanations outside of the guide itself. Begin your response with the Markdown header # Code Style Guide and continue from there.
