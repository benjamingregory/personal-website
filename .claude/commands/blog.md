Whoof -- where to begin...

I graduated in December 2021 with my MBA in-hand and was ready to get back into startups. Not as early as before but still with a lot of potential. I had done one of my internships at a publicly traded company and the second at a private company but with over 2000 employees. Both of these left me missing the experience I had pre-business school of being able to focus on building vs "socializing ideas" in an effort to get internal momentum. I just really wanted to work with some great engineers and designers and build a great product that our customers loved. I was really happy to find that opportunity in Deliverr.

Then, under a really strange set of events, I found myself having worked at three companies led by four CEOs under five direct managers under 18 months. I will probably cover as much as I can in another blog post but TLDR; Deliverr was bought a month after I joined by Shopify and then sold by that company a year later to Flexport.
gif

Deliverr was great -- very impressive founders and culture. Shopify was....big. Too big and very slow. Flexport was....Ok, as a disclaimer I need to say that I'm speaking as someone who was there only for four months but also one who is no stranger to chaotic environments (I've missed many a paycheck because the startup just forgot to issue payroll) and I've pulled more than my share of all-nighters to get something ready before a demo.

Flexport was challenging. At the risk of violating my NDA, I'll leave it at that.

I found myself included in a round of layoffs at the end of 2023 (it was a very good thing) and feeling burnt out on building product. Without going into too much detail (again, best suited for another blog post), trying to build a product when the organization is in the process of being sold and resold is like pulling teeth while riding a horse...on a bumpy road. I was demoralized and frustrated trying to launch a product when simple things like "What is the name of our company?" couldn't be answered.\* Everything from what style of components should our engineers build in to what website is our marketing copy going to be hosted on was up in the air. We would have weeks of work that had to be thrown out when someone at the top changed their mind about something.

After leaving, I thought heavily about whether I still wanted to work in product. I really loved working with a multi-disciplinary team of engineers and designers and I REALLY love getting to show customers something that we built based on their feedback. But 18 months of trying to build product in a dysfunctional environment left a bad taste in my month.

I needed to rediscover my love of building products. This feels very self-indulgent to say but hey, I'm a proud "Touch Feely" grad after all and more importantly, I really didn't feel that I could be an effective product manager at any other company without it. I decided I wanted to try to build a product entirely start to finish.

That product ended up becoming MONROE, your pop culture companion.

Background

I consider myself very technical for a product manager. I've worked exclusively in data intensive products in many different stacks and have written production code in Go, Python, and Node. I've worked on CLIs, web apps, and data pipelines, and countless scheduled scripts.

Coming off of building a product that was subject to corporate machinations of a company being sold and then sold again, I wanted to build something that was entirely in my control. But I've never built a product completely from start to finish. I've always had the benefit of working with brilliant designers and engineers to collaborate with. To be honest, that bothered me.

This was a perfect opportunity to build a product that I wanted, build it to be exactly what I wanted, and learn some stuff along the way. Plus, in the time that I had dipped my toes into the world of logistics, a little thing called ChatGPT launched and seemingly changed everything. Having my own product would allow me to experiment with AI and see what all the fuss was about.

I definitely didn't know exactly what I was getting into (which was essentially the point), but about 100k lines of code later, I have a product that I'm proud of and that I think is a good start to a larger vision.

What is the problem?

I really enjoy television. I enjoy everything from the trashy drama of Real Housewives of Salt Lake City to the prestige drama of Succession. I think the Great British Bake-off is as exciting as Deadliest Catch. I love the alt-comedy of Nathan for You and I love network sitcoms like New Girl. There is probably a lot to unpack here but it goes back as far as I can remember. Let me just say that my love for television goes back to at least the late 90s when I would watch Friends with a camcorder pointed at the screen before family road trips so I could rewatch it in the car from the 2 inch viewfinder.

These days, every time I'm at a dinner party, inevitably the conversation turns to "What are you watching right now?" and there is also something I add to my list.I think we're in a golden age of television but for me trying to keep up to date on new shows can feel like a full-time job. Hyperbolic? Maybe -- but for context, I've currently started 92 different shows and have another 203 new shows on my watchlist. And it seems like every day theres a new show that someone recommends to me.

Why isn't there an easy way to track what I'm watching, see what's coming up next, and get recommendations based on what I've watched before?

What is the solution?
Movies have Letterboxd.
Books have Goodreads.
But television?
There's no good way to keep track of what you're watching, what you've watched, and what you want to watch. MONROE is a platform that allows you to do just that.

(And before you say it, yes I know about Trakt, Serializd, etc. I've tried them and found their UI cluttered and features lacking. They weren't for me. But more power to you if they work for you.)

The Stack

App: Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Clerk
Before I took the job at Deliverr, I was tinkering around with a podcast app that I was building with Next.js. I appreciated some of the "batteries included" features of Next.js like a straightforward routing system and the ability to easily add API routes. Tailwind was new to me but I kept hearing about it on the Youtube videos so I decided to give it a try. To be honest, I have always hated pure CSS. I found it's syntax to be convuluted and unintuitive. Tailwind was a gamechanger for me; everything was clean and easy to read. It kept me in the flow of building the app while rapidly changing the styling. As someone without a designer to work with, my design process basically involved building the app and then changing things over and over again until it looked good.

For authentication, I used Clerk for no particular reason other than I never think it's good to roll your own authentication when you're a small team. I am a very small team all myself so I was happy to offload the authentication to Clerk.

API: Node.js, Prisma, Express, Docker
I've used Python the most but only used Django once and haven't used Flask at all. To keep things simple for myself and stay in one language's headspace, I decided to use Node with Express. This was a stack used by the first company I worked at (which at this point was ~10 years ago) and I had confidence that the ecosystem around it was mature enough to ramp up on.

AI: Python, Langchain, OpenAI, ChromaDB

I was excited that Langchain had a Javascript SDK but to be honest, I found the documentation was lacking compared to it's Python counterpart. I also really didn't like the syntax of LCEL (Langchain Expression Language) and found it too declarative and abstract to be useful. I can see it being useful if you are already familiar with it but I found it difficult to learn, especially given how fast it was changing. Everytime I found a tutorial, something about it would throw an error or reference an older version of the SDK.

I eventually decided that I didn't need to benefits that Langchain could theoretically provide (switching LLMs on the fly) and decided to just integrate directly with the OpenAI API direclty.

I knew I wanted to tinker with an open-source vector DB and tried a few options (Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone) but ended up going with ChromaDB because it was the most straightforward to setup for a simple use case. I can see the benefits of the others for more of a production use case with a team that is going to be fine-tuning constantly but for my use case, I just needed to store vectors and query them for a simple chat engine.

DB: Postgres, Redis
I use Postgres. It's stable and scalable. Not really a whole lot else to say. I know that some people swear by MongoDB for prototyping but I've found that NoSQL inevitably becomes more trouble than it's worth.

Because I was retrieving a large amount of data from this Postgres that wasn't really going to change, I decided to cache it in Redis to speed up performance. This made a huge difference in the experience using the app (everything was just much smoother) and invalidating the cache when data was changed was very straightforward.

Data: Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Knex, Cron
I truly hate bulk loading data. I've done it so many times and the smallest problem can take days to debug. I once tried to transfer data from MongoDB to a Postgres database and it kept failing because of timestamp formatting issues. I spent three days working through every row, eventually normalizing 17 distinct timestamp formats into one that would work. (e.g. 12/8/99, 12/08/1999, Dec 8, 1999, December 8, 1999, etc.). I truly hate this work and it's a large reason I moved away from data engineering.

Because I wasn't loading terabytes of data at a time and (theoretically) only had to load it once, I decided download the data as JSON, load it into memory using a Pandas dataframe, and then bulk insert it into Postgres. When this worked, this was great. When it didn't because of a null value in a required column or a missing foreign key to another table, I had eschew the bulk upload and insert each row one by one. This was annoying but I was able to speed things up using the knex library in Node, which allowed for asyncronrous inserts.

Infrastructure: Vercel, Railway, Github
I've used various cloud providers in the past (mostly AWS and GCP) and there's no getting away that they're more flexible and affordable. But -- and this is a big caveat -- I really don't recommend using these for solo developers / small teams. The value proposition of any boutique hosting service is pretty straightforward; they abstract away the complexity of managing your own infrastructure in exchange for a slightly higher variable cost. While they are likely just running a k8s cluster on top of the major providers, it is enough of a value to just set it and forget it that I think it's worth it.

Vercel is slightly different in that it's soemwhat of a PaaS than a pure hosting service. The ability to deploy a Next.js app and take advantage of all the features (optimized image cache, serverless functions, edge network, etc.) is another way I could get some performance boosts without having to think about it.

Between the app on Vercel and the DB / API on Railway, my CI/CD pipeline was as simple as pushing to Github. This honestly ended up being one of the most valuable investments early on as I was able to push changes to production with a single command and iterate on them rapidly. The con is that you have to be careful not to develop bad habits and just push everything to master without checking for breaking changes. I did this a few times and even if it's not hard to undo, it's just embarrasing to crash your app in production, even if no one is using it yet.

Payments: Stripe

For payments, I decided to use Stripe. Like Auth (but even more so), I'm not going to try to rebuild the wheel taking payments. The way I wanted to bill was a single monthly fee to use the app beyond a certain point. So at least that meant that I didn't need to worry about the complexity of different pricing tiers or usage-based billing. I looked at Lemon Squeezy and Recurly and can absolutely see the benefits that they provide. Honestly, I prefer going with a smaller provider in a professional setting as you generally can get better support and there is more flexibility in pricing. That being said, for this project because it was just me, I went with Stripe because it had far and away the best documentation and community support. That's not a knock on the other two -- it's just a result of being the dominant leader; more people are using it and answering questions on StackOverflow, writing blog posts on Medium about the experience, etc. The power of community is such a strong force.

Key features
Adding the ability to watch shows together

I knew from the outset that one of the core features I wanted to add was the ability to a watch a show with your friends. I wanted to make it seemless to not only share what you've been watching regardless of streaming platform but also to know where your friends are in a show so you can catch up and watch it together.
I thought this would be pretty straightforward -- just add a "watch together" button, right? Turns out it was much more complex than I was expecting.

I started by creating a model for a UserConnection that would store the userId of one person and the userId of the person being invited to watch. So I added the model of a UserGroup. This would connect the UserShow (the model of an instance of a user watching the show) to a group. This allowed for multiple people to be in one group and watch the show together. So then I just needed to add the ability to add people to the group. Simple enough, right? But you don't want to just allow anyone to add anyone else to a group? What if you don't know the person inviting you? Or just don't want to join the group?

So you need the concept of a UserInvite as a limbo state between being invited and joining the group. And then you need to add the ability to accept or decline the invite. But you also don't want to have to accept every invite every time you want to watch with a group. Think of a groupchat -- sometimes its nice to just be spontaneously be added by someone you know and then leave the group if you want. So you also need a model of a "UserConnection" to indicate that the invitees are connected and can watch together immediately. So just to allow this one feature, I needed to add three additional models and manage the state of each of them.

AI Chat Engine w/ Personalization

There's a whole world of people building "thin wrappers" around ChatGPT -- so I thought, hey - how about one more?
Chat Conversation

Relevant News -- Bulk Categorization using AI

I didn't just use AI for the chat engine to get recommendations. One of the features I wanted to build was to pull in news articles about the shows you've been watching. This seems simple and the scraping part of it is. Just used BeautifulSoup to scrape the articles and then store them in a Postgres. The hard part was categorizing them accurately and in a scalable fashion. Even if it was obvious that an article was about, say, the show Succession, I needed to be able to tie that back to the exact show id in my database. Now, I could do that manually for a couple but for all of them, that was not going to happen.

So I first pulled all shows from my database along with their show ids and descriptions and fed that to the OpenAI database as part of a system prompt. For context, Monroe has about 176k shows in its database so this was a substantial amount of data. I then fed each article into the OpenAI API and asked it to output a JSON object with the article_url and show_id. I took this output and stored it in Postgres. Altogether, it took about $30 to process but saved me days of manual work and I ended up with around 10k categorized articles to seed the news feed.

Internal Tools
What I did Too Soon

Dark Mode Exploring a new idea is really exciting because it's a blank canvas
on which you can exercise your creativity. That being said, prioritization is still important and there are some things that I wish I had prioritized differently. Specifically, I'm thinking about adding a Dark Mode switch. I'll start by saying that using the app at night with a darker theme is much easier on the eyes. Now that I have it, I do really like it. But I wouldn't have started it so early for two reasons: 1) it's not a core feature that affects the core user experience or materially addresses the problem the product is trying to solve and 2) it slows down the development of new features as now everything has to have both a light and dark theme. Yes, eventually I would have had to do this but it would be much easier to do it all at once rather than piecemeal.

Episode Specific Conversations

A second feature that I wish I had waited on was the chat features. It's a feature that isn't useful in isolation. So you have a cold-start problem as no one wants to start the conversation and the action-reward cycle is essentially non-existent if there are not others engaging in the discussion with you. Unless you have high activity, it's going to feel like a ghost town. So why did I build this so early? Well, put simply, it came out of a discussion on Product Hunt and I thought it would be a fun challenge to explore.
Product Hunt

For something like a movie, which exists in a binary-state -- you've either seen it or you haven't. In that case, it's pretty easy to design a chat feature that allows you to discuss the movie as a whole. You can organize the chat by topic threads to discuss themes, events, reveals, theories, etc but the only piece of information you need going in is whether or not the user has seen it.

Television is different. It's story is serialized and can be told over dozens (or even hundreds) of installments taking place over years both in-world and in real-time. The show is stopped at discrete invtervals, with the viewers understanding of the show changing depending on where they have stopped. Designing a chat feature in this environment is much more complex because you need to know where the user is in the show to avoid spoilers.

As a first step, I added the ability to start a chat on a specific episode basis. If you click on an episode, a popover window opens with the current discussion. If you have seen the episode, it will show the current discussion. If you haven't, it will show a warning that there may be spoilers ahead. This required me to model the concept of a conversation that can be associated with the show and episode and then a message concept that can be attached to a conversation. This was a great way to expand out the data model but on reflection, I can already see ways that its limited.

<example_post_4>

There's an understandable tension between creative tools and automation. There is a legitimate fear that AI flattens creativity, making everything look the same. This fear is not without merit but it can also cause industries like gaming to be late adopters to tech that could otherwise help solve widespread problems, such as the overreliance of crunch (i.e. unpaid overtime), a problem so bad there's even a Wikipedia article about it.

There has to be a solution and to see what companies are developing in this space, I decided to attend GDC 2025 last week. Several companies are leveraging AI in game development in exciting ways but there’s one I really wanted to highlight.

Coplay: The Cursor for Game Development
Coplay has developed a chat interface plugin for game engines (currently supporting Unity, with plans to expand to other platforms). At GDC, Jos van der Westhuizen, co-founder and CEO, demonstrated how Coplay can make game edits and create entire new levels from scratch, complete with physics and combat mechanics.
Rather than try to explain it myself, I'll let them do it:

alt text

After their presentation, I had the opportunity to discuss the product's future with Joned Sarwar, co-founder and CTO. Our conversation sparked some interesting ideas about where this technology could evolve.

Note: The following represents my own vision for the technology's potential, not necessarily Coplay's roadmap. They may disagree with all this entirely.

Level 1 – Vibe Game Development
The “vibe” moniker can be polarizing; people kind of have a kneejerk reaction to it as either a revolutionary accelerant or a tech debt nightmare waiting to happen. I think the truth is in the middle. For both early learning and rapid prototyping, the ability to stay in the flow, I do have to say, is game changing and Jos showed a great demo where he showed this in practice.

Creating boilerplate menus, tweaking settings without having to dig through five levels of customization options, adding scripting logic for character interactions, and even physics to collisions and movement -- all of this stuff is trivial to do with Coplay. This is the most immediate use case for Coplay and I think it’s going to be a hit with both new developers who have a fuzzy vision of what they want but don't necessarily know how to get there and experienced developers who know exactly what they want and don’t want to spend time clicking through menus to get there.

Level 2 - Agentic Game Development
From their experience building games, the team at Coplay clearly knows that devs have workflows that are specific to their project and style. That's why there's a recording button where you can have Coplay watch what you're doing and record the actions to learn what is happening and what is trying to be accomplished. Walking the model through each step of the process is exactly what you would do with a new member of your team and will help the AI understand the context of what you're asking and avoid hallucinating and creating something totally far afield. This is where I think Coplay could really shine. Imagine a world where you have a team of agents who are trained on accomplishing specific tasks.

Agents could specialize in scene development (e.g. Create a shader for a rainy day scene with reflective puddles and dark clouds), asset creation (e.g. Generate a dense, overgrown forest with varied terrain, ancient ruins, and soft, diffused lighting.), or even NPC mechanics (e.g.Generate an AI script for an enemy that patrols an area, chases the player on sight, and retreats when health is low.) Not only that, but they could do it by following the same workflow you are already using. What’s more, agents could leverage MCPs to plug into other generative platforms -- something Coplay can already do with integrations into Meshy and Tripo for asset creation. Once AIs are intialized with proper context, they could work together to take the seed of a game that is tightly tuned and build out new levels, variations on existing levels, or even entirely new games in the same style.

Level 3 -- Abstracted Game Development
Watching Coplay go through the Unity platform, understand developer workflows, and adjust settings on it's own is really exciting and demonstrates how ripe the game industry is for AI disruption. But you can already see a world where Coplay lives as a full abstraction layer on top of any game engine. In this world, Coplay is the main interface with the engine living underneath it. Users interact with Coplay similar to how Roblox has done it with a simplified workflow on top of their own game engine. In this version, however, the game engine becomes secondary to the translation layer (in this case Coplay) and game development as a feature can become as easy as embedding a chat or drag-and-drop interface with an iframe representing the Scene / Game View.

This may sound kinda far-fetched but there are two analogues that come to mind here.

1. Model Abstraction in AI Feature Development
   We can easily forget this talking with other AI creators but for the most part, the average person (even one using AI tooling) does not know which models they are using and in what combination. Don't believe me? Ask someone not in tech what their opinion of GPT-4.5 vs Claude 3.7 Sonnet. (I already know some of you reading this already have strong opinions ready to go.) But, to an average person, when trying to get through customer service, ask Siri a question, or edit a document, they just care about results. The best companies creating workflows for AI development (make.com, n8n, langchain) are really good at abstracting away implementation details so the user can focus on results. In a similar way, Coplay could make reasonable defaults for settings / parameters inside the game engine and allow developers to focus on the game they want to create. What's more, Coplay could offer a set of primitives that encapsulate Unity workflows / logic that can then be used by other companies to develop their own Roblox-like platforms.

2. Native Code Abstraction in React Native
   React Native enables cross-platform development through a write-once, deploy-everywhere framework. React Native is not so abstracted as to be a drag and drop interface; in fact, it is extremely powerful and can be complex in the types of apps and structures you want to create with it. When a specific native feature is required, developers can "eject" their application into platform-specific code (e.g. Java / Obj-C). This is a one-way ejection so there’s no going back but then you have a full project of native code set up with a lot of boilerplate already done. A game engine itself is a set of abstractions collected into a single environment but that's not to say that it’s the final form of game development. Unity / Unreal (the native source) may be the right tool for the job eventually for pixel-perfect clarity but not for prototyping and quick iteration.

Remaining Thoughts
With the high-level vision out of the way, I wanted to dive into some of the technical challenges that Coplay will need to overcome to reach these levels of abstraction. I think there are two broad areas that Coplay will need to focus on to succeed.

Intelligent Context Management
Modern games comprise thousands or even tens of thousands of unique files—a labyrinth of assets, scripts, and configurations that could potentially be prohibitively expensive (either in pure $$$ or just time / efficiency) to tokenize and process in their entirety. This is perhaps Coplay's most significant technical challenge but could also be a competitive advantage if done correctly. The true breakthrough for an AI implementation of this scale isn't merely getting an AI to perform impressive tasks. It needs to be able to parse an enormous context yet still operate in near real-time to feel like a true extension of the developer. And while it doesn't need to be cheap necessarily, it does need to be able to justify it's own existence so throwing more resources at it isn't the solution if the cost becomes prohibitive.

Advanced techniques might include:

-Persistent context on high-level project architecture
-Graph-based representation of project components that maps relationships
-Dynamic context windowing that focuses on relevant files and relationships
-Specialized agents trained for relevant context retrieval

Autonomous Agent Governance
Coplay comes with variable settings for the extent to which the AI should make changes to your project (e.g. Normal vs. Beast mode where the AI will take on much more responsibility and independent judgements.) The question becomes then that if you have a team of agents working on a project, perhaps completely independently, how do you ensure changes made by these agents are in line with the vision of the project? For that, I think there are three necessary features (which, by the way, they may already be working on, not sure):

1. Version Control - This is a must-have for any project but especially for one where multiple agents are making changes. There already is Unity Version Control but imagine being able to see the agent's chain-of-thought, identify where an agent went off-course, roll back to that previous state and start a new iteration. Or branch it from a certain point and test an alternate version. With this version control for generative AI, agents can create as many permutations of a project as desired and the developer can choose the one that best fits their vision.

AI-specific versioning would incorporate:

The agent's chain-of-thought reasoning for each significant change
Decision points where development could have followed multiple paths
The ability to branch from specific decision points to explore alternative implementations
Metadata about contextual factors influencing decisions

2. Agentic Permissions - Like any external developer that you would grant system access to, there need to be guardrails of what resources the AI can access and what it can do with them. The Normal vs. Beast mode is the beginning of this and helps match developer velocity with risk tolerance. But that assumes that there is a Human in the loop, which is a massive help in ensuring each change is in line with the project vision. In a fully agentic system, being able to to give specific permissions and motivations to agents helps simulate a real-world team environment. You can easily imagine a system where one agent responsible for asset creation is given more leeway to experiment with new styles and techniques while another agent responsible for combat mechanics is given more strict guidelines to follow.

A sophisticated permission system might:

Assign specific capabilities and restrictions to different agent types
Create domain-specific permissions (e.g., visual assets versus gameplay mechanics)
Implement graduated autonomy that increases as agents demonstrate reliability
Establish approval workflows for changes exceeding certain impact thresholds

3. Contextual Audit Logs - Seeing that a setting was modified is one thing but understanding the context of why it was changed, what logic went into making that change, and what else was changed alongside it is essential for ensuring the project doesn't become a black box that no one can understand. I believe this was mentioned in the talk but I think it's worth reiterating that this is a critical feature for any AI-assisted development tool.

A comprehensive audit system would capture:

The contextual information available to agents when making decisions
The reasoning process leading to specific implementation choices
Relationships between seemingly unrelated changes
Potential alternative approaches considered but not implemented

There's a lot more to say about Coplay but I'm out of time for now. I think, in summmary, the most promising aspect of Coplay's approach is that it doesn't attempt to replace human creativity. Rather, it amplifies by removing barriers between conception, experimentation, and implementation. In doing so, Coplay might actuallly help fulfill the original promise of game engines themselves: making game development more accessible without sacrificing depth or possibility.
