# Ideate improvements based on upgraded packages

The packages we're using may have changed.

Look at the git history to see which packages changed (if any) and recommend some improvements to take advanatge of
the most recent versions.

Use the web research agent to understand the version differences.

If no packages have changed or there are no meaningful improvements to implement, say so and do nothing.
