## The Stack

<br />

### **App:** Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Clerk

Before I took the job at Deliverr, I was tinkering around with a podcast app that
I was building with Next.js. I appreciated some of the "batteries included" features
of Next.js like a straightforward routing system and the ability to easily add API
routes. Tailwind was new to me but I kept hearing about it on the Youtube videos
so I decided to give it a try. To be honest, I have always hated pure CSS. I found
it's syntax to be convuluted and unintuitive. Tailwind was a gamechanger for me;
everything was clean and easy to read. It kept me in the flow of building the app
while rapidly changing the styling. As someone without a designer to work with, my
design process basically involved building the app and then changing things over
and over again until it looked good.

<br />
For authentication, I used Clerk for no particular reason other than I never think
it's good to roll your own authentication when you're a small team. I am a very small
team all myself so I was happy to offload the authentication to Clerk.
<br />

### **API:** Node.js, Prisma, Express, Docker

I've used Python the most but only used Django once and haven't used Flask at all.
To keep things simple for myself and stay in one language's headspace, I decided
to use Node with Express. This was a stack used by the first company I worked at
(which at this point was ~10 years ago) and I had confidence that the ecosystem around
it was mature enough to ramp up on.

### **AI:** Python, Langchain, OpenAI, ChromaDB

<br />I was excited that Langchain had a Javascript SDK but to be honest, I
found the documentation was lacking compared to it's Python counterpart. I also
really didn't like the syntax of LCEL (Langchain Expression Language) and found
it too declarative and abstract to be useful. I can see it being useful if you
are already familiar with it but I found it difficult to learn, especially given
how fast it was changing. Everytime I found a tutorial, something about it would
throw an error or reference an older version of the SDK.

<br />I eventually decided that I didn't need to benefits that Langchain could
theoretically provide (switching LLMs on the fly) and decided to just integrate
directly with the OpenAI API direclty.

<br />I knew I wanted to tinker with an open-source vector DB and tried a few
options (Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone) but ended up going with ChromaDB because it
was the most straightforward to setup for a simple use case. I can see the
benefits of the others for more of a production use case with a team that is
going to be fine-tuning constantly but for my use case, I just needed to store
vectors and query them for a simple chat engine.
<br />

### **DB:** Postgres, Redis

I use Postgres. It's stable and scalable. Not really a whole lot else to
say. I know that some people swear by MongoDB for prototyping but I've found
that NoSQL inevitably becomes more trouble than it's worth.

<br /> Because I was retrieving a large amount of data from this Postgres that
wasn't really going to change, I decided to cache it in Redis to speed up
performance. This made a huge difference in the experience using the app
(everything was just much smoother) and invalidating the cache when data was
changed was very straightforward.
<br />

### **Data:** Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Knex, Cron

I truly hate bulk loading data. I've done it so many times and the smallest
problem can take days to debug. I once tried to transfer data from MongoDB to a Postgres
database and it kept failing because of timestamp formatting issues. I spent three
days working through every row, eventually normalizing 17 distinct timestamp formats
into one that would work. (e.g. 12/8/99, 12/08/1999, Dec 8, 1999, December 8, 1999,
etc.). I truly hate this work and it's a large reason I moved away from data engineering.

<br />
Because I wasn't loading terabytes of data at a time and (theoretically) only had
to load it once, I decided download the data as JSON, load it into memory using a
Pandas dataframe, and then bulk insert it into Postgres. When this worked, this was
great. When it didn't because of a null value in a required column or a missing foreign
key to another table, I had eschew the bulk upload and insert each row one by one.
This was annoying but I was able to speed things up using the knex library in Node,
which allowed for asyncronrous inserts.
<br />
### **Infrastructure:** Vercel, Railway, Github

I've used various cloud providers in the past (mostly AWS and GCP) and there's no
getting away that they're more flexible and affordable. But -- and this is a big
caveat -- I really don't recommend using these for solo developers / small teams.
The value proposition of any boutique hosting service is pretty straightforward;
they abstract away the complexity of managing your own infrastructure in exchange
for a slightly higher variable cost. While they are likely just running a k8s cluster
on top of the major providers, it is enough of a value to just set it and forget
it that I think it's worth it.{" "}

<br /> Vercel is slightly different in that it's soemwhat of a PaaS than a pure
hosting service. The ability to deploy a Next.js app and take advantage of all
the features (optimized image cache, serverless functions, edge network, etc.)
is another way I could get some performance boosts without having to think about
it.

<br /> Between the app on Vercel and the DB / API on Railway, my CI/CD pipeline
was as simple as pushing to Github. This honestly ended up being one of the most
valuable investments early on as I was able to push changes to production with a
single command and iterate on them rapidly. The con is that you have to be
careful not to develop bad habits and just push everything to master without
checking for breaking changes. I did this a few times and even if it's not hard
to undo, it's just embarrasing to crash your app in production, even if no one
is using it yet.

<br />
### **Payments:** Stripe
<br />
For payments, I decided to use Stripe. Like Auth (but even more so), I'm not going
to try to rebuild the wheel taking payments. The way I wanted to bill was a single
monthly fee to use the app beyond a certain point. So at least that meant that I
didn't need to worry about the complexity of different pricing tiers or usage-based
billing. I looked at [Lemon Squeezy](https://lemonsqueezy.com/) and [Recurly](https://recurly.com/)
and can absolutely see the benefits that they provide. Honestly, I prefer going with
a smaller provider in a professional setting as you generally can get better support
and there is more flexibility in pricing. That being said, for this project because
it was just me, I went with Stripe because it had far and away the best documentation
and community support. That's not a knock on the other two -- it's just a result
of being the dominant leader; more people are using it and answering questions on
StackOverflow, writing blog posts on Medium about the experience, etc. The power
of community is such a strong force.
